 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning project based on the Iris dataset, one of the most famous datasets in machine learning and data analysis. The project demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the development of a classification model to predict the species of iris flowers.

Features of the Project
Dataset Analysis:
Descriptive statistics for all features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
Distribution plots and correlation analysis.
Pairwise comparisons between features.
Data Visualization:
Scatter plots to visualize feature relationships.
Species-wise comparisons using box plots and violin plots.
Machine Learning Pipeline:
Data preprocessing (scaling and encoding).
Training a classification model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment (Optional):
Interactive Streamlit web app for predictions (bonus feature if needed).
Dataset Information
The Iris dataset contains 150 records of iris flowers, with the following attributes:

Sepal Length (cm): Length of the sepal.
Sepal Width (cm): Width of the sepal.
Petal Length (cm): Length of the petal.
Petal Width (cm): Width of the petal.
Species: The type of iris flower (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, or Iris-virginica).
