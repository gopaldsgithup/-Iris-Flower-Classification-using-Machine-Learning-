The Iris dataset is publicly available and originally published by R.A. Fisher. It is commonly used for educational purposes in data science and machine learning. You can find the dataset in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.


 Iris dataset is used for:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution and relationships between features.
Machine Learning Model Development: Predicting the species of the iris flower based on its measurements.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
